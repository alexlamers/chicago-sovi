# Chicago Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)

This project builds a **Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)** for **Cook County, Illinois** using U.S. Census data.  
The goal is to create a modular R workflow that can be reused for other cities or states, and to provide an open dataset for exploring relationships between **social vulnerability** and **environmental issues** such as flooding, heat risk, or climate resilience planning.

---

## üìä Data Sources
- **American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates**  
  Pulled directly via the [census.gov API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html).  
- **Geographic Unit**: Census tracts in Cook County, IL.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Variable Selection**  
   - Variables commonly used in SoVI research (e.g., income, education, housing, race/ethnicity, age, disability, employment).  
   - Indicators standardized for comparability.  

2. **Normalization**  
   - All variables are normalized to a **0‚Äì1 scale** for consistency.  

3. **Two Approaches**  
   - **CDC SoVI (`svi_cdc.csv`):**  
     Uses the CDC‚Äôs weighting scheme, where indicators are grouped and combined into four domains (Socioecomonic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, Housing Type & Transportation) before final scoring.  
   - **PCA SoVI (`sovi_pca.csv`):**  
     Uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality and capture variance in the data.  
     This approach identifies key drivers of vulnerability empirically, rather than relying on predefined weights.

*A comparison between PCA-based and CDC-weighted SoVI scores. Red line shows linear fit (R¬≤ = 0.694).* 

*Correlation between the two methods was r = 0.833*

## üîç Next Steps
- Map results in **R (ggplot2/tmap)** or **QGIS** for visualization.  
- Compare SoVI scores against environmental data (e.g., flood risk, heat islands, pollution burden).  
- Expand the workflow for other counties and states in a more generalized script.
